(ns home-photo-bank.photo-store
  "Store and retrive photos in categories. Categories
  are nested folders in the file system, which could
  be anything (needs testing), but commonly year/month/day.

  Special directories:
  _import: photos ready to import
  _process: photos that need processing before import
  _failed: photos that failed to import
  _thumbs: thumbnails for imported photos.

  Guarantees:
  This module will never modify files. It will rename
  them both to move to storage folders and to add keywords
  but only when moving from _process to _import.
